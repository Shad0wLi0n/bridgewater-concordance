# Concordance

### Thanks for taking a look, installation instructions and a brief overview follow below.

## Notes:

The project was written in the react framework and bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I made use of the [Skeleton CSS Boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com/) as well. As a Front End Developer, I believe a clean, simple UI is just as important as a thorough solution. The application is fully responsive.

The app is divided into 4 components:
1. App - Main container
2. Input - Input elements and controls
3. SentenceStats - Word counts
4. Table - The concordance display

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository. In your terminal type:
#### `git clone git@github.com:Shad0wLi0n/concordance.git`
2. Navigate to the app directory:
#### `cd concordance/app`
3. Install the project:
#### `npm install`

## Starting the Server and running the project locally:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
